# Country Finder

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This project was developed for a term project, and I'm in my first year of undergrad CS. It's not a full-fledged product or anything that serious. The purpose of the project was to explore API integration, DOM manipulation, and web development in general.

## 📌 Description
Country Finder is a simple web app that allows users to search by country name (or abbreviation, in most cases) and retrieve details (capital, region, population, currency, major languages). Users can also discover random countries and save their favorite ones with personal notes.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔎 **Search** for any country using the input field.
- ♾️ **Discover** a random country.
- ⭐ **Save favorite countries** to local storage.
- 📝 **Add notes** for favorite countries.
- ❌ **Remove** a country from favorites.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS
- REST API: [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/)
- Local Storage API for saving favorites and notes
- Used AI (primarily ChatGPT) to help with a few semantic problems, and readability).

## 🕰️ Future Scope

If I return to this project in the future, I would like to make the following improvements to it:
- Use further APIs to integrate weather finding & travel planning features, thereby expanding its usage
- Turn the pop-up alerts into actual modals to get a notification effect that self-collapses without manual intervention
- Display favorites in a more robust, tabulated form with all relevant details
- Custom background images for different countries, or at the very least, by region or weather status
